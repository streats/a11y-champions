<html>
    <head>Testing headers</head>
    <body>
        <h1>The very first header</h1>
        <h2>Now for a second header<h2>
            This is some normal text. 
            <h1>What happens if we put another H1?</h1>
            We shouldn't do this because there should only be one H1 per page, and it should be first. 
            <h3>Let's follow that with an H3 where we shouldn't</h3>
            We might be tempted to use an H3 because it's smaller than an H2 and maybe we don't want something so big, but it means we've skipped a level which can be confusing. 
            <h4>But having an H4 now if totally OK</h4>
            This is the next logical level, so no problems here.
